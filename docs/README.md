## üéØ Key Design Decisions

### Multi-Window Curvature Analysis
The corner detection algorithm uses multiple window sizes (5m, 10m, 15m, 20m) simultaneously to accurately detect both gradual curves and sharp corners. This approach prevents missing tight apexes while maintaining awareness of the broader corner context.

### McRae 1-6 Severity System
Corner severity is based on actual measured radius, not guesswork:
- **1 (Hairpin)**: <20m radius
- **2 (Sharp)**: 20-40m
- **3 (Medium)**: 40-70m
- **4 (Open)**: 70-120m
- **5 (Slight)**: 120-200m
- **6 (Near-straight)**: 200-500m

### Intelligent Chicane Merging
Two corners within 40m of each other can be merged if:
- Neither is severity 1 (hairpins never merge)
- Severity difference ‚â§ 3
- Both have direction information
- Creates natural rally callout: "4 LEFT into 6 RIGHT"

### Severity-Aware Length Modifiers
"Long" and "Short" modifiers use different angle thresholds based on corner severity, because:
- A "long" hairpin (110¬∞) is physically short (~38m at 20m radius)
- A "long" severity 6 (110¬∞) would be impossibly long (~577m at 300m radius)

This prevents nonsensical callouts and maintains natural rally rhythm.
