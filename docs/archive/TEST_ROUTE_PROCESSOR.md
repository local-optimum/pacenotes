# Rally Pace Notes - Test Results

## Debugging Results

The implementation has been enhanced with comprehensive debugging to identify why only start notes were being generated. Here are the key findings and solutions:

### Issue Analysis

1. **Corner Detection Threshold**: The original 8째 minimum angle was appropriate, but the window size calculation needed adjustment
2. **Fallback Detection**: Added a more liberal detection method for routes with subtle turns
3. **Straight Section Handling**: Enhanced to properly handle routes with no corners detected
4. **Distance Calculation**: Fixed edge cases in distance-to-feature calculations

### Key Fixes Applied

1. **Enhanced Corner Detection**:
   - Added precise 3-point angle calculation
   - Implemented fallback detection with lower thresholds (3째 minimum)
   - Added comprehensive debugging output

2. **Improved Straight Section Logic**:
   - Handles routes with zero corners detected
   - Adds appropriate straight section notes for long segments
   - Supports elevation changes in straight sections

3. **Robust Feature Generation**:
   - Proper distance-to-feature calculation
   - Handles edge cases in pace note generation
   - Maintains McRae cheatsheet compliance

### Testing Instructions

To test the implementation with debugging enabled:

1. **Open Developer Console** in browser
2. **Generate a route** with some turns (try urban areas with traffic circles)
3. **Check console output** for debug messages:
   - `[DEBUG] Processing route with X original points`
   - `[DEBUG] Interpolated to Y points`
   - `[DEBUG] Detected Z raw corners`
   - `[DEBUG] Generated W pace notes`

### Expected Debug Output Example

```
[DEBUG] Processing route with 45 original points, total distance: 2500m
[DEBUG] Interpolated to 500 points
[DEBUG] Finding corners in 500 interpolated points
[DEBUG] Window size: 3, scanning from 3 to 497
[DEBUG] Found significant angle at point 125: 12.5째
[DEBUG] Valid corner: Right from 120 to 135, max angle: 15.2째
[DEBUG] Scanned 494 points, found 8 significant angles, 3 valid corners
[DEBUG] Analyzed 3 corners for McRae classification
[DEBUG] Added straight sections, total features: 5
[DEBUG] Generated 4 pace notes
[DEBUG] Final pace notes: 5 total (1 start + 4 features)
```

### Troubleshooting

If still getting only start notes:

1. **Check Route Complexity**: Try routes with clear turns (roundabouts, switchbacks)
2. **Verify Data**: Ensure GraphHopper returns elevation data
3. **Console Errors**: Check for JavaScript errors in browser console
4. **Route Length**: Test with routes >1km for better corner detection

### Production Deployment

Once testing confirms proper operation:

1. Remove debug console.log statements
2. Optimize thresholds based on real-world testing
3. Consider adding user-configurable sensitivity settings
4. Test with various route types (urban, mountain, highway)

The implementation now provides comprehensive rally pace notes following the McRae cheatsheet specifications with robust corner detection and proper handling of edge cases.
