## 🚀 Unique Selling Points

### 🎯 **Advanced Corner Detection Algorithm**
Our sophisticated multi-window radius analysis doesn't just detect corners—it understands them:
- **Multi-window curvature analysis**: Evaluates corners using 5m, 10m, 15m, and 20m windows simultaneously
- **Instant turn detection**: Catches sharp 90° street corners that traditional algorithms miss
- **Smart turn positioning**: Places markers at the actual turn-in point, not the geometric center
- **Direction consistency checks**: Prevents false corner detection when GPS track zigzags

### 🔗 **Intelligent Chicane Merging**
Automatically detects and merges close sequential corners into rally-standard chicane calls:
- **Automatic detection**: Merges corners <40m apart with compatible severity
- **Professional format**: Generates "4 LEFT into 6 RIGHT" callouts
- **Visual linking**: Yellow dashed lines connect merged corners on the map
- **Chain indicators**: Linked markers show 🔗 badge for instant recognition

### 🗺️ **Interactive Visual Experience**
A map interface designed for rally enthusiasts:
- **Sequential marker animation**: Markers appear progressively every 0.1s along the route
- **Severity-based color coding**: Instant visual identification of corner difficulty
  - Red (Severity 1-2): Hairpins and sharp turns
  - Orange/Yellow (3-4): Medium corners
  - Blue/Green (5-6): Fast sweepers
- **Hazard warnings**: Pulsing markers with ⚠️ badges for crests, jumps, and dips
- **Click-to-highlight**: Click any marker to center and highlight the corresponding pace note
- **Chequered flag finish**: 🏁 emoji marks the end of your stage

### 📍 **Location Search Integration**
No more copying coordinates from Google Maps:
- **GraphHopper geocoding**: Search for locations by name
- **Intelligent suggestions**: Real-time location search as you type
- **One-click selection**: Fly to location and set start/end points instantly

### 📊 **McRae 1-6 Severity System**
Based on actual corner radius measurements, not guesswork:
- **1 - Hairpin**: <20m radius (U-turns, tight switchbacks)
- **2 - Sharp**: 20-40m radius (Tight corners)
- **3 - Medium**: 40-70m radius (Standard corners)
- **4 - Open**: 70-120m radius (Fast corners)
- **5 - Slight**: 120-200m radius (Gentle bends)
- **6 - Near-straight**: 200-500m radius (Very slight curves)

### 🎨 **Smart Modifiers & Hazards**
Context-aware callout enhancements:
- **Length modifiers**: Severity-aware thresholds (a "long" hairpin ≠ "long" sweeper)
- **Radius changes**: "tightens to 2" or "widens to 5" when radius shifts >20%
- **Elevation hazards**: 
  - `Crest` - Blind peak (>5m/100m climb)
  - `Dip` - Compression (>5m/100m descent)  
  - `Jump` - Airborne potential (>10m change in 50m)
- **Advisory notes**: "Caution", "Blind", "Heavy Braking" based on corner analysis

### 📤 **Professional Export**
Competition-ready output formats:
- **PDF Export**: Formatted document ready for printing or digital display
- **Text Export**: Plain text for custom workflows or integration
- **Live Preview**: Real-time pace notes panel with distance counters

### 🎭 **Rally-Authentic UI**
Every pixel designed for the rally experience:
- **Red & yellow theme**: Classic rally service park aesthetics
- **Monospace typography**: Clear, co-driver-friendly font rendering
- **Progressive notes panel**: Scrollable list with distance-to-next indicators
- **Mobile-optimized**: Works on tablets and phones for in-car use (for educational purposes!)

## 🔬 Algorithm Deep Dive (For Enthusiasts)

### Route Interpolation & Preparation
```
Raw GPS Points (variable spacing)
    ↓ 
Interpolated to 3m Resolution (~333 points/km)
    ↓
Distance Calculation (cumulative along route)
    ↓
Ready for Analysis
```

**Why 3m?** Optimal balance between accuracy and performance. Fine enough to catch radius changes in tight corners, fast enough for real-time processing.

### Corner Detection Pipeline

#### 1. **Multi-Window Curvature Analysis**
For each point along the route:
```typescript
windowSizes = [5m, 10m, 15m, 20m]
for each window:
    calculate radius using 3-point circumradius
    
finalRadius = min(all radii)  // Tightest curve wins
```

This multi-window approach catches both:
- **Gentle approaches**: Detected by larger windows
- **Sharp apexes**: Detected by smaller windows

#### 2. **Sustained Corner Identification**
```
if radius < 500m:  // Curved threshold
    → Start corner tracking
    
while radius < 500m AND direction consistent:
    → Continue corner
    
if straight section ≥ 4-6 points (adaptive):
    → End corner
```

**Adaptive straight detection**: Tighter corners require more straight points to end (prevents split detection at apex).

#### 3. **Instant Turn Detection**
Traditional methods miss sharp GPS corners. We check for:
```
bearing change > 60° over 6 points (~18m)
AND
local radius < 100m
```

This catches 90° street intersections, tight chicanes, and hairpins with sparse GPS data.

#### 4. **Smart Turn Positioning**
Corners aren't called at their geometric center—they're called at turn-in:

For tight corners (severity 1-2):
```
Find first point where radius ≤ 130% of minimum radius
```

This places the callout where the driver actually turns the wheel.

#### 5. **Direction Consistency Checks**
Critical safety feature:
```
if corner direction changes mid-segment:
    → Split into TWO corners
    → Prevent false "tightens" detection
```

Example: A left-right chicane will NEVER be reported as a single corner that "tightens".

### Severity Determination

**Special Turn Types** (only if geometrically appropriate):
- **Hairpin**: 150-180° angle AND severity 1-2 (prevents loose hairpins)
- **Square**: 75-105° angle AND severity 1-3 (actual 90° corners)
- **Acute**: <60° angle AND severity 1-3 (V-junctions)

**Standard Numeric Severity**: Based on radius thresholds (see McRae system above)

### Radius Change Detection

Analyzes corner in thirds:
```
firstThird = average radius of first 1/3
lastThird = average radius of last 1/3

if (lastThird - firstThird) / firstThird < -20%:
    → "tightens to X"
    
if (lastThird - firstThird) / firstThird > +20%:
    → "widens to Y"
```

Only reports if direction stays consistent throughout.

### Chicane Merging Logic

Two corners merge if:
1. Distance between them < 40m
2. Neither is severity 1 (hairpins never merge)
3. Severity difference ≤ 3
4. Both have defined direction
5. Creates: `"4 LEFT into 6 RIGHT"`

### Length Modifier Calculation

**Severity-aware thresholds** based on arc length physics:
```
Arc Length = Radius × Angle (in radians)

Severity 1-2 (tight):
    Long: >110°  (~38m at 20m radius)
    Short: <35°  (quick flick)
    
Severity 5-6 (fast):
    Long: >45°   (~189m at 200m radius)
    Short: <20°  (gentle kink)
```

Prevents nonsensical "long severity 6" calls (would be 577m!).

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### API & Routing Issues

**"Invalid API key"**
- Check `.env` file exists and key is correct
- Verify key has elevation access enabled in GraphHopper dashboard

**"No route found"**
- Ensure coordinates are accessible by road (not across ocean/terrain)
- Try zooming in on map and clicking more precise points
- Check GraphHopper API status

**"Route generation failed"**
- Clear browser cache and reload
- Check browser console for detailed error messages
- Verify start/end points are on road network

### UI & Display Issues

**Map not loading**
- Check internet connection (map tiles require network)
- Verify Leaflet CSS is imported in `index.html`
- Try different browser (Chrome/Firefox recommended)

**Markers not appearing**
- Wait for sequential animation to complete
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Refresh page and regenerate route

**Export not working**
- Check browser allows downloads from localhost
- Try different browser
- Verify PDF library loaded correctly (check console)

### Performance Issues

**Slow route generation**
- Expected for long routes (>50km) - complex analysis
- Markers animate in real-time (0.1s each)
- Consider shorter test routes during development

## 🧪 Development

### Available Scripts

```bash
npm start          # Development server (localhost:3000)
npm test          # Run test suite
npm run build     # Production build
npm run eject     # Eject from Create React App (irreversible!)
```

### Code Quality

- **TypeScript**: Strict mode enabled for type safety
- **ESLint**: Enforces code standards
- **Prettier**: Auto-formatting on save (recommended)

### Testing a Route

Good test coordinates (verified to work):
```
Start: 40.7589, -73.9851  (New York - Central Park)
End:   40.7489, -73.9680  (Manhattan streets - good chicanes!)
```
